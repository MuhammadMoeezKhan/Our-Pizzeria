# Our-Pizzeria

**Code to be uploaded shortly**

##### Created a demo application for companies dwelcing in the food industry!
The user can order an item from the presednted Menu, that contains each item's:
- Name
- Description
- Price
- Rating

The Menu list is completely dynamic, the company's manager needs to directly add the name, description, ratnig, and price for the code to automatically update the menu. This is done using an Android List View, Custom Adapters, Android Convert Views, and the Base Adapter interface!

Opening up a new food chain? This app is for you! (Reach out to me as well, I too am interested!!)
